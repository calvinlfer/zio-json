title:  "About zio-json"
---

The goal of this project is to create the best all-round JSON library for Scala:

- **Performance** to handle more requests per second than the incumbents, i.e. reduced operational costs.
- **Security** to mitigate against adversarial JSON payloads that threaten the capacity of the server.
- **Fast Compilation** no shapeless, no type astronautics.
- **Future-Proof**, prepared for Scala 3 and next generation Java.
- **Simple** small codebase, short and concise documentation that covers everything.
- **Helpful errors** are readable by humans and machines.
- **ZIO Integration** so nothing more is required.
